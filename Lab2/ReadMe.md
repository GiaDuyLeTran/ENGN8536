This lab was to get a hands-on experience using pytorch and creating a simple neural network.

An additional task was to try experimenting a model and check how it compares with the model given in the lab.

The Experimental network model is loaded in NetExperiment.py.
Use the NotebookExperiment.ipynb to test it.
